# Analyzing Instagram Engagement

### Key Questions:
- What content type **engages the most** with the company's Instagram audience?
<br><br>
-  The Instagram database was analyzed **from the user's first post about the brand until March 27th**.
<br><br>
- Some guidelines were followed during the analysis:
    - The "views" column was disregarded; our focus was solely on likes, comments, and interactions.
    - Empty tags were treated as such, with no tags assigned to them.
